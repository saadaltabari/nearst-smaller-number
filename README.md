# Nearest Smaller Number

This repo contains a script which was developed for solving a HackerRank problem.
The problem was the following:

For any given array of Stock prices `StockPrices` of size `n (0 < n < 1000000)`.
`StockPrices[i]` is an integer representing stock price on day `i`. where `0 < i < n` and `0 < StockPrices[i] < 1000000`.

For an array of days `Days` of size `m  (0 < m < n)`. `Days[j]` is an integer representing a day to be queried where `j (0 < j < m)`. Find the nearest day `X` from `StockPrices` where `StockPrices[X] < StocPrices[Days[j]]`


## Enhancemnts

working on generalizing this scritp by implementing it as a library for finding the nearest smaller number.
